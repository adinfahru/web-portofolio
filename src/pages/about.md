This academic background has provided me with a solid foundation in understanding the intricate workings of software development and its impact on businesses. I am passionate about frontend developing. 

I love to think about problem solving and developing ideas based on user experience. Therefore, I often carry out social, research and academic projects, take online courses, participate in competitions and participate in various activities that help improve skills and knowledge.
